# invasives_rpts
This project modifies an MS Access application front end utilized for invasive species reporting. 

Modifications include: 
* Target list tool for species target list creation
* Modularized database framework (partially implemented for this application)
  * Modules specific to the application separate from application-specific modules
  * Tabular UI within the target list tool

The project includes only front-end modifications. Back-end databases and schema changes are excluded.

Overall, the project is focused on providing a streamlined, efficient workflow for handling invasives species list generation, reporting, and archiving without relying on manually generated lists.
